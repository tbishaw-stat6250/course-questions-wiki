[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 1]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How common it is to abbreviate the word "repository" as "repo"?
- Question (jbettonville−stat6250): The question on the quiz mentions five items that must be completed, but the instructions for the initial setup have two separate lists of tasks to complete, the first being "Preparing Week 1 Setup Components" with six items, and the second being "Submitting Week 1 Setup Components" with four items.

- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): Do all quizzes have roughly the same number of questions or will the length vary widely? (i.e. Can we expect to spend roughly the same amount of time on quizzes each week, or will some require signficantly more time than others?)
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): If students successfully complete at least 8 of the 10 scheduled quizzes by their assigned due dates, what achievement will they get?
- *Answer* (cnguyen77-stat6250): They will earn Reading for Depth Achievement toward their course grade.



[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 4]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How will code reviews for projects be conducted? Will they involve comments on code in GitHub, meetings with the instructor, or both?
- Answer (ilankham−stat6250): Both; Code Reviews will involve 1:1 meetings with the instructor held through Google Hangouts, during which project code will discussed and commented.
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): At the moment it appears that instructions about only the first step of the first project are available in Blackboard; when will the information about the next steps in each phase of the projects be made available to students?
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): How many team-based projects are required to complete in this course?



[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 5]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How similar to Weekly Quiz problems will final exam problems be? In other words, if I want to best prepare for the final exam throughout the course, should I primarily focus on thoroughly understanding weekly quiz problems?
- Answer (ilankham−stat6250): The best way to prepare for the Final Exam is to work through every assigned Weekly Quiz Problem and to develop an understanding of all concepts involved to the point that the problems can be thoroughly answered without consulting reference materials.
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): Based upon past offerings of this course, what percentage of students who have taken this exam have achieved a score of 70% or higher?
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): How many multiple-choice questions does the Final Exam consist?



[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 6]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Is the ability to earn five total achievements at all related to the common employee rating scale of 0-5, with 5 being the highest possible level of performance?
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): Based upon past offerings of this course, which, if any, of these achievements are students most likely to fail to earn?
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): To earn an A in STAT 6250 this quarter, what achievement/achievements does a student should earn?



[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 7]

[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 8]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Why does the instructor give extra credit for catching mistakes he's made? Is it to reassure students that everyone makes mistakes, or help him proofread his course materials, or both?
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): What is the mechanism by which extra credit is applied? (i.e. which achievements does it impact, and may it impact different achievements depending upon the circumstance under which it is awarded)
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): I assume the instructor can provide a precise answer, but it seems to me that extra credit to be given for catching errors or seeking clarification would tie into the Reading for Depth Achievement, since it involves thoroughly reviewing written content. I would also think that contributions to the Course Questions Wiki beyond the Week 10 quiz may also relate to the Building General Knowledge and Team-based Problem Solving achievements; in any case I would like to know more about this for sure.
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): In what ways does the instructor give extra credit for students in this course?



[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 9]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Instead of a carrier pigeon, what about an unladen swallow?
- Answer (ilankham−stat6250): An African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): What is the reason for requesting contact via Slack instead of via email or Hangouts?
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): One possible reason is that Slack allows for communication and collaboration to happen quickly among a large group. Email is not necessarily pushed to all devices instantaneously (especially with current limitations on push email through Gmail for iPhones), so messages sent via Slack can be reviewed and responded to with less of a delay, and communications can be centralized for all members of the group.
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): What is the best way to contact the instructor with questions/comments?
- *Answer* (cnguyen77-stat6250): Make a direct messages sent through the course Slack team.



[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 10]

- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): Can you recommend any methods of tracking changes to each platform regularly?
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): Blackboard has the "Announcements" page visible upon login that includes any new documents and pages that have been added. The Slack desktop app shows badges on the icon when new posts are available. The Horizon email system can be set up and checked by a mail client regularly. GitHub appears to track activity for each user, but at this time it is unclear if it will also track new updates to repos that have been forked. Any other suggestions for workflow management are appreciated!
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): Why should students check their CSUEB-provided Horizon Email Accounts daily?
