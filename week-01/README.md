[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 1]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How common it is to abbreviate the word "repository" as "repo"?
- Answer (mresendiz3-stat6250): It's more common to abbreviate "repossess" as "repo" instead of "repository." However it's important to note that the frequency of the abbreviation "repo" would have to depend on the scope and nature of the conversation (whether discussing computer science or financial trouble.) In terms of Git, your project folder, which is having all the files required for your project is known as Repository or in short Repo. Everything that you do with regard to your project stays in the repo. When you make changes and save the files, along with saving the file, you also commit them in Git (via its shell program). Committing changes assure that the changes are preserved with regard to the time and day you committed them
