[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 1]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How common it is to abbreviate the word "repository" as "repo"?
- Answer (lsun20-stat6250): For me, it's not very common to abbreviate the "repository" as "repo". I usually thought "repo" like "report" or "repost", because I didn't use github before. After I search online, I found that the programmer allways make the "repository" as "repo" in daily work.
- Answer (mresendiz3-stat6250): It's more common to abbreviate "repossess" as "repo" instead of "repository." However it's important to note that the frequency of the abbreviation "repo" would have to depend on the scope and nature of the conversation (whether discussing computer science or financial trouble.) "In terms of Git, your project folder, which is having all the files required for your project is known as Repository or in short Repo. Everything that you do with regard to your project stays in the repo. When you make changes and save the files, along with saving the file, you also commit them in Git (via its shell program). Committing changes assure that the changes are preserved with regard to the time and day you committed them."

- Answer (tchan49−stat6250): This is new way of testing yourself whether you understand the course materials or not. We are all used to the old way of examination where we sit there and take the exam provided by the professor. However, creating our own questions is an effective way to discover what questions you should know so that you can fully understand the information you are reading.

- Answer (tchan49−stat6250):Professional programmers need to have a can-do spirit where they are able to support teammates when they need help and do work together. Also, professional programmers are capable of paying attention to details and identifing problems quickly. They look at the problem at big picture and small picture as well. They should not be afraid of making mistakes but instead, they can point out the mistake quickly and solve it before it becomes unredeemable.

- *Question* (aacharya4−stat6250): What is the difference between Data Step and Proc Step in SAS?
- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): 
Data Step: A portion of the SAS program that begins with a DATA statement and ends with another DATA statement, RUN statement or PROC statement. Generally, in SAS Data steps are used to manage data like input data, modify data etc.
 
![sascode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35093776/34646199-cfe2294a-f316-11e7-9df0-80a3f1af4709.png)

In this case, everything between the “data Grade” and the first “run” statement constitutes the Data Step. The output of this step is given below:

Proc Step: A portion of the SAS program that begins with a PROC statement and ends with another PROC statement, RUN statement or DATA statement. Generally, in SAS Data steps are used to analyze data like doing descriptive statistics, generate graphs and charts and generate reports etc.
In this case, everything between the “proc print” and the second “run” statement constitutes the Proc Step. The result as seen in the Result Viewer.

[fizz-buzz Week 1 SAS Recipe]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Is the mod function at all related to how clocks work, with hours counting from 1 to 12, and then starting back at 1 again?
- Answer (lceballos-stat6250): The mod mod function is related to how a clock works in that there are only a fixed number of values that it could hold. There are about 8760 hours in a year so a clock works very similar to a mod function; mod(hour,12) would be the function of the clock. The 5000th hour of the year would show as 8 on the clock.
